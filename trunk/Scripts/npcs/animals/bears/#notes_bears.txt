[== Age of Darkness: Revisions ==]
- REMOVED: Deleted all bird_types from spherechar.scp
- REMOVED: Deleted all bird_types from spherechar_anim.scp
- ADDED: Added the folder "animals" for organization purposes.
- ADDED: Added the folder "birds" for organization purposes.
- MODIFIED: Every creature has its own definition block.
- ADDED: Crow; updated to the new animations.
- ADDED: Magpie; should not be stand alone and should be on a list of
  bird names.
- ADDED: Raven; should possibly be on the same name list. If not
  it should get upgraded script wise (ie stats, skills, & abilities).
- ADDED: Parrot (Bird); this is the new animation from SA.
- ADDED: Parrot (Deco); new animation from ML. Has the same stats as
  SA one. None of the EA code for stand or wafer is implemented.
  Deco and Bird parrots are in the same file.
- ADDED: Crane; SE Expansion bird.
- ADDED: Very Ancient Crane
- ADDED: Turkey; I assume this is in anim.mul and won't need any
  backwards compatability. I don't have an older client to test.
- ADDED: Giant Turkey; Notes are within its file, ai is NOT scripted!
  it is located in the turky file. No loot was done for it either.
  Meant to be a group fight boss-level mobile.
- ADDED: Jungle Birds; refer to FCs.
- ADDED: Tropical Birds; refer to FCs.
- ADDED: Forest Birds; refer to FCs.
- ADDED: Chicken; should they be laying eggs?
- ADDED: Greater Chicken; it is contained in the chicken script.
- ADDED: Phoenix; need to define a better spell list.
  Upgraded the animation to the new SA one.
- ADDED: Eagle; nothing to note.


[== FCs (Future Changes) ==]
- MODIFICATION: Jungle Bird; should this be consolidated into
  just tropical or vice versa? Seems redundant.
- MODIFICATION: Name lists for birds needs major updating.
- MODIFICATION: Remove c_bird_* and change to c_* from the
  following list: crow, magpie, raven, & parrot (non-deco).
- MODIFICATION: Need to move phoenix later. It is a monster
  not an animal.
- MODIFICATION: Sounds should be checked for actions for possible
  errors or weirdness.
- MODIFICATION: Might up the "very ancient crane" and the
  "greater chicken" damage resource.
- MODFICIATION: Give "very ancient crane" and "greater chicken"
  there own script file separate of their lesser mobile brethren.

[== FAs (Future Additions) ==]
- ADDITION: Add to a new backwards compatability file old defnames
  that will be changed later and make neccesary changes in any
  dependant script files.
- ADDITION: Vulture; could use the eagle anim and hue it brown,
  grey, or black. Would be nice for a arid setting.
- ADDITION: Duck; this could be easily done. Just use the chicken
  animation and hue it. Set it to swim and it should work fine.
