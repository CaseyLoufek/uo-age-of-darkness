				l Trinsic is a clever place. They've got fellows there who spend all day thinkin' about weapons of war and other such things to improve the quality of life.
				l I saw a combat mage on his way to Trinsic once. Said he was going to teach battle magic to the paladins.
				l I met a man from Jhelom who said that Trinsic buys war horses like a shepherd buys apples!
				l 'Tis too smart for me there by half, and that's the truth. Trinsic is all engineers from Britain and Minoc and Moonglow. I'd be feared to speak for soundin' stupid.
				l I don't know much about Trinsic. I think they make paladins or palaquins or something.
				l Trinsic is a tough place. The whole thing is warriors, and the rest is city guards.
				l There be giants, ogres and trolls near Trinsic ... and pirates in the waters.
				l Trinsic? 'Tis the land's guardian, a city that teaches paladins the ways of honor and virtue.
				l 'Tis a place of swift justice, is Trinsic. Thieves are as rare as whistling cats.
