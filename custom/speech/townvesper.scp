				l They need a fair amount of goods in Jhelom. They once tried to set up a colony - called New Jhelom - to grow their goods for 'em. It didn't work out. Now it's called Nujel'm and 'tis a nasty wicked place.
				l There's not a lot of natural good to be grown or mined at Jhelom. Rocky, thou knowest.
				l Jhelom? They breed and train the best horses in the realm. Famous for it.
				l 'T'ain't no horse better than a Valorian steed from Jhelom. Best war-mount a warrior could want.
				l Jhelom? Pah! 'Tis a militocracy. Only ex-generals can rule, or some such nonsense.
				l 'Tis very like Trinsic and Serpent's Hold. If thou likes one, thou wilt enjoy t'other.
				l Jhelom sounds dangerous to me. Everybody's armed and 'tis said they'll challenge thee to a duel for no good reason.
				l They're very daring in Jhelom. Good swordsmen and skilled riders.
				l Thou'lt do fine in Jhelom. 'Tis only cowards they despise.
				l Cannot l I care much for the ethics of Jhelom. Watch thy comrade's back, watch thine own. Paranoia, I call it.
				l I saw a dance from Jhelom once. 'Twas done in Britannia. Looked like hackin' and slashin' and kickin' to me. Take away the music and thou wouldst call it a riot!
				l Jhelom? Now there is a town without a lick of beauty. Sad, really.					ENDDO

				l They use magic in Magincia to keep from doing work. Seems like cheating to me.
				l There's not much farm land near Magincia, that much I can tell thee. They'd rather pay to have food brought to them.
				l They'd not let the likes of us live in Magincia. 'Tis a city with only ladies, no ladies-in-waiting.
				l I think they have a diamond mine in Magincia.
				l They are lucky to have magical protection in Magincia. Not a city cares for them, and people hereabouts would like to teach them manners.
				l Someone told me that the fine lords and ladies in Magincia hire peasants to talk to peasants. Keeps them a bit father away from the common riffraff, I suppose.
				l It's said that in Magincia, they'd rather look good than feel good.
				l The main difference between someone from Magincia and a peasant is that the Magincian is NOT a PEASANT! If thou see'est what I mean.
				l They produce nothing in Magincia but snobs and money.
				l Someday they'll run out of diamonds in Magincia, and with hunger will come wisdom and compassion.
				l Magincia is a land of over-plenty and overmuch pride.
